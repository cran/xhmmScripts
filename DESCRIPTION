Description: R scripts for plotting and assessing XHMM whole-exome-sequencing-based CNV calls. XHMM (eXome Hidden Markov Model) is a C++ software package (http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/xhmm) written to call copy number variation (CNV) from next-generation sequencing projects, where exome capture was used (or targeted sequencing, more generally). This R package enables the user to visualize both the PCA normalization performed by XHMM and the CNVs it has called.
